## Report

### Assumptions

I have assumed that the characteristics of the TSP instance will be largely similar across the public and private cases.

### Implementation

I have implemented the greedy algorithm, nearest neighbors heuristic-based algorithm, 2-OPT algorithm and simulated annealing. Then, I ran the provided TSP Validator on them, and compared the costs incurred by each algorithm.

### Results

As expected, the greedy algorithm gets equivalent results on small inputs at a much faster speed than the other heuristics-based algorithms. As the input gets larger, the other algorithms get much lower costs than the simpler algorithms such as greedy and nearest-neighbour.

While I had initially thought that the 2-OPT algorithm would perform better than SA for euclidean inputs, it turns out that SA performs just as well. So, I threw away my initial setup which resembled

```py
if tsp_type == 'EUCLIDEAN':
    two_opt()
else:
    sa()
```

and chose to just run simulated annealing for all inputs. Let's see how it works out.


### Improvements

I had to increase the number of iterations, reduce the cooling rate, and reduce the initial temperature of simulated annealing in order to obtain lower costs. I couldn't increase it too much as then it would risk crossing the 300-second limit. With my current estimation using the time complexity of the algorithm, and a bit of leeway for the vCPU the code will be tested on, the current parameters should be fine.
